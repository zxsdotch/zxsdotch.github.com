  <p class="editable">My past experience includes building sensitive systems at small startups,
    defense entities, and large companies. For example, I co-invented Hack, Facebook/Meta's
    typesystem for PHP. I built or maintained various payments related microservices at Square/Block,
    including an open source cold storage solution. I also consulted for many Swiss private banks.</p>
