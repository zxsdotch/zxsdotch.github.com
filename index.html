					<p class="editable">At a stealth startup, Alok helped bring us up to speed quickly on the quirks of HSMs (esoteric hardware for cryptography). I've enjoyed working with him. He's very eager to share his knowledge, and he's curious, patient, and self-motivated. He led successful investigations to characterize HSM performance and to decipher some useful but undocumented features. Beyond HSMs, he's also been a valuable asset as a security generalist.</p>
