I noticed my various infosec-related channels have been talking a lot about
Passkeys lately. Are they going to replace passwords? Is it a loss of user
control? These are very good and excelllent questions. Adam Langley wrote an
[excellent blog post](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2023/07/23/u2f-to-passkeys.html).
If you also have Passkeys on your mind, start by reading Adam's post.

I'm looking forward to better authentication systems on the web. Also,
