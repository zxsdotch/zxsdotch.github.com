[tl;dr sec](https://tldrsec.com/) is a weekly newsletter by [Clint Gibler](https://twitter.com/clintgibler). The newsletter summarizes what's going on the infosec world. The content covers a wide range of topics. I found out about it because Clint Gibler heads Security Research at semgrep and a
very good friend of mine happens to work there.

You can [preview issue #195](https://tldrsec.com/p/tldr-sec-195) before deciding to subscribe to the newsletter for yourself.
