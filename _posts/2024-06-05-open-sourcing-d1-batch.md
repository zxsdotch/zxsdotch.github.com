The combination of Cloudflare's developer platform, which includes R2, D1,
Workers, Queues, and Workers Analytics Engine results in a very compelling
platform for young companies. You can build and launch software products with
very low operational expenditure.

Our experience building on Cloudflare's platform has lead us to open source
[d1-batch](https://github.com/zxsdotch/d1-batch). This is a library that makes
is easier to batch queries to Cloudflare's D1 database.

In terms of next steps, we plan to share a collection of useful "recipes". These
will be pieces of code you can use as building blocks and modify per your needs.
